An illustration: UVa Online Judge [47] Problem Number 10911 (Forming Quiz Teams). Abridged Problem Description:
Let (x, y) be the coordinates of a student’s house on a 2D plane.
There are 2N students and we want to pair them into N groups.
Let di be the distance between the houses of 2 students in group i.
Form N groups such that cost = 􏰀Ni=1 di is minimized.
Output the minimum cost. Constraints: 1 ≤ N ≤ 8 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000.
Sample input:
N = 2; Coordinates of the 2N = 4 houses are {1, 1}, {8, 6}, {6, 8}, and {1, 3}.
Sample output: cost = 4.83.
